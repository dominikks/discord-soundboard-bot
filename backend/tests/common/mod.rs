/// Common test utilities and mock implementations

/// This module provides shared test utilities and mock implementations

/// Future additions:
/// - Mock Discord API for member/guild lookups
/// - Mock Songbird voice client
/// - Test data builders for common structures

    // Mock structures will be added here as needed for integration tests
    // For now, we keep this minimal as a placeholder
